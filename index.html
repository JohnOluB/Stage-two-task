        <h1>My goals for the next two years in tech</h1>
          In the next two years, I see myself working as a full stack developer.
          Prior to that, I must have sharpened both my frontend and backend
          skills I plan on building a website like udemmy. And also I want to
          increase my proficiency in modern frameworks and libraries like
          angular and vue. Learn about their ecosystem, including state
          management libraries. I also want to stay updated with the latest
          trends, tools, and technologies in frontend development. I would take
          online courses, read books, and attend webinars and conferences. I
          would like to also build a professional network by attending industry
          events, joining online communities, and collaborating on open-source
          projects. I would also like to put finishing touches to my backend
          program.
